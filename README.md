# UK Census Data Analysis 

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a synthetic UK town using census-style data. The data was generated using Python's Faker library and aims to simulate a real-world census process as it might have been done in the UK in the 1880s.

##  Objective

- Clean and transform raw census data
- Extract meaningful demographic and economic insights
- Visualise population structures and social indicators
- Offer recommendations for town planning and investment

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Faker (for dataset simulation)

## Key Visualisations

- **Population Pyramid** – age and gender distribution
- **Employment Category Distribution** – employed, student, child, retired
- **Religion Distribution** – breakdown of religious affiliation
- **Marital Status by Age** – patterns by age groups
- **Housing Occupancy** – top 10 streets with highest average household size

## Summary

The town is dominated by a middle-aged population with strong employment numbers, yet limited local job opportunities. Around 43% of the population are likely commuters. There's a declining birthrate and a significant portion of the population with no religion. Housing is underutilised in many areas.

## Recommendations

- Improve local job creation (e.g. manufacturing investment)
- Prepare healthcare infrastructure for ageing population
- Consider adding a rail station to reduce motorway pressure
- Avoid new housing projects; optimise existing housing stock
- Construct one additional church to meet religious needs
